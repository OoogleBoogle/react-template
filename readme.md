# React Template

### Uses:

**React & Babel:** Obviously.

**CSS:** Sass is autoprefixed, cleaned(purifycss) and uses PureCSS framework. (TODO: Sort out css minification on production build)

**Webpack:** Dev build has everything lumped together for speed. Production build splits concatenated CSS into separate file and JS off into 3 to aid caching.

**Mocha and Chai:** For tests.
