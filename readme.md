# React Template

This is my react setup, it's an ongoing process. But it provides a basic blueprint to work from with Webpack setup to 
handle everything (based on the setup from [surviveJS](http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/)).

### Details:

**CSS:** Sass is autoprefixed, cleaned(purifycss) and uses PureCSS framework. (TODO: Sort out css minification on 
production build)

**Webpack:** Dev build has everything lumped together for speed. Production build splits concatenated CSS into 
separate file and JS off into 3 to aid caching.

**Mocha and Chai:** For tests.

### Installation

If you want to use this template, you'll need a few things.

NPM, Node installed on your machine and a GitHub account. Also, Hub for the command line. You can find details [here](https://hub.github.com/).

You can then just clone this as usual. However, I have put a small script together [here](https://gist.github.com/OoogleBoogle/db5d97b8d3e631f3ae7cfd9fde33521d)
which will do all the heavy lifting for you. If you're new to this idea, all you have to do is put a copy of this in
your $PATH (personally, mine is in the '/usr/local/bin/') and then setup an alias in your .bash_profile (or whatever
you use), like so: `alias setup_react="/usr/local/bin/setup_react.sh"` so now all i have to do is type 'setup_react' in 
my terminal.

### Scripts

'npm run setup:react' => sets up the project, detailed above.

'npm start' => runs the dev server. Available on localhost/8080 and will refresh automatically.

'npm test' => to run your test suite.

'npm run dev' => to start both the express server and webpack, just to check it's all wired up properly.

'npm run build' => will make your production build in a separate build folder. (you can run 'webpack -p' in the terminal 
instead but I'm not a fan of the output);

'npm run stats' => will produce a stats file for use [here](https://webpack.github.io/analyse/)....apparently....it's 
never worked for me.
